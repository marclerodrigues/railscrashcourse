As you can see, file contains a string. Use file.split to convert
the string into an array of words. You can now use Rubyâ€™s built-in
array methods to operate on the contents of the file. For example, use
file.split.length to count words in the file. file.split.uniq.length tells
you how many unique words are in the file.
Using the array of words from Exercise 1, count how many times each
word appears in the file. One way to do this is by iterating over the
array and storing the count for each word in a hash where the key is
the word and the value is the count.
